<h2>main.cpp:</h2>
<b>class CIntHasher:</b> <br>
Provides a simple hash function for integers.<br>

<b>Equalmaps Template Function:</b><br>
Compares two CXMap instances to check if they contain the same key-value pairs.<br>

<b>XString Operations:</b>

Creation and Comparison: Examples of creating CXString instances and comparing them.<br>
Substring: Extracts a substring and prints it.<br>
Trim: Trims whitespace from a CXString.<br>
Find: Searches for a substring within a CXString.<br>
Split and Join: Splits a string by a delimiter and joins a vector of strings with a delimiter.<br>
Append: Appends one CXString to another.

<b>CXList Operations:</b>

String List: Demonstrates appending, prepending, inserting, and removing elements from a CXList of CXString.<br>
Integer List: Demonstrates appending and printing elements of a CXList of integers.

<b>CXMap Operations:</b>

Insertion: Inserts key-value pairs into a CXMap.<br>
Dumping: Dumps the contents of the map before and after removing certain elements.<br>
Iteration and Removal: Iterates through the map, removing entries with a specific value.

<b>Standard Library Map:</b>

Comparison: Shows similar operations using the standard std::map.

<b>Advanced CXMap Usage:</b>

Copy and Assignment: Demonstrates copying and assigning CXMap instances.<br>
Key Extraction: Extracts keys from a CXMap.<br>
Equality Check: Uses the Equalmaps function to compare maps.
