<h2>main.cpp:</h2>
<b>class CIntHasher:</b> 
Provides a simple hash function for integers.

<b>Equalmaps Template Function:</b>
Compares two CXMap instances to check if they contain the same key-value pairs.

<b>XString Operations:</b>

Creation and Comparison: Examples of creating CXString instances and comparing them.
Substring: Extracts a substring and prints it.
Trim: Trims whitespace from a CXString.
Find: Searches for a substring within a CXString.
Split and Join: Splits a string by a delimiter and joins a vector of strings with a delimiter.
Append: Appends one CXString to another.

<b>CXList Operations:</b>

String List: Demonstrates appending, prepending, inserting, and removing elements from a CXList of CXString.
Integer List: Demonstrates appending and printing elements of a CXList of integers.

<b>CXMap Operations:</b>

Insertion: Inserts key-value pairs into a CXMap.
Dumping: Dumps the contents of the map before and after removing certain elements.
Iteration and Removal: Iterates through the map, removing entries with a specific value.

<b>Standard Library Map:</b>

Comparison: Shows similar operations using the standard std::map.

<b>Advanced CXMap Usage:</b>

Copy and Assignment: Demonstrates copying and assigning CXMap instances.
Key Extraction: Extracts keys from a CXMap.
Equality Check: Uses the Equalmaps function to compare maps.
